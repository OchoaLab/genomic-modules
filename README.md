# Genomic Resource Modules

## Goal

Our overall goal is to contribute in creating a diverse and dynamic genomics and genetics workforce. We aim to achieve this by training genetics and genomics enthusiasts from the greater Raleigh-Durham area, focusing on the historically marginalized communities. <br>


These modules enable researchers from diverse labs to use publicly available genetics and genomics data and resources to understand and advance investigation of their research questions. 

## Content
