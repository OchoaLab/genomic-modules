# Genomic Resource Modules

## Goal

Our overall goal is to contribute in creating a diverse and dynamic genomics and genetics workforce. We aim to achieve this by training genetics and genomics enthusiasts from the greater Raleigh-Durham area, focusing on the historically marginalized communities. 

These modules enable researchers from diverse labs to use publicly available genetics and genomics data and resources to understand and advance investigation of their research questions.
