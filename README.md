# Genomic Resource Modules <img src="logo-CCGR-GSP.png" alt="Genomic Scholars Program" align="right" />

## Goal

Our overall goal is to contribute in creating a diverse and dynamic genomics and genetics workforce. We aim to achieve this by training genetics and genomics enthusiasts from the greater Raleigh-Durham area, focusing on the historically marginalized communities. <br>


These modules enable researchers from diverse labs to use publicly available genetics and genomics data and resources to understand and advance investigation of their research questions. 

## Learning Objectives

- To understand how disease genes are discovered using genome-wide association studies and admixture mapping, using kidney disease and APOL1 as as example.
- To understand how population and family structure confound association studies, and apply solutions for modelling such relatedness.
- To learn approaches to study how a variant has an effect on gene expression and may result in a disease.
