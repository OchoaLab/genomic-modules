For this exercise, you will need to download an application called Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) and four data files that are stored in the day1/Exercise directory.

# IGV
Navigate to the following link to download the appropriate version for your computer system. Note that IGV requires a recent version of Java in order to run. If you do not have a recent version of Java installed on your computer (or are unsure), make sure to select the download option for your computer system that says "Java Included."
